Hi! I'm Daniel Alp, a Grade 12 student attending St. Theresa of Lisieux catholic high school. My interests lie in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and robotics, and I love to explore any new areas of these fields. In my school, I am involved in the computer science club and robotics club. Outside of school, I work part-time tutoring curriculum and competitive mathematics.

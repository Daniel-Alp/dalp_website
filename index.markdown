Hi! I'm Daniel Alp, a Grade 12 student attending St. Theresa of Lisieux Catholic High School. My interests lie in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and robotics, and I love to explore any new areas of these fields. In my school, I am involved in the Computer Science club and VEX Robotics club. Outside of school, I work part-time tutoring curriculum and competitive mathematics. 
<br><br>This website is a repository of my favourite projects. Thanks for checking it out!
